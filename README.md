# InventoryApp
This is an inventory app called MyInventory that runs on Android mobile devices and helps users sort products or items.

MyInventory is currently in development, with its primary function focused on storing data. The mission of MyInventory is to help small businesses manage their inventory more efficiently, under the slogan "Sort Smart, Work Easy." I understand that many small business owners may be managing their operations alone and don’t have much time to update inventory effectively. MyInventory aims to simplify this process by allowing them to manage their products through their phone anytime, anywhere. The app icon is designed simply, featuring the bolded name MyInventory to keep it straightforward, user-friendly, and easy to navigate. The app’s background features a gradient blue color, chosen to create a calm and professional appearance.
       
MyInventory uses API 34 (Android 14) as the target SDK, allowing it to leverage the latest features available on the Android platform and ensuring compatibility with the most current devices. 
At present, MyInventory requires only one permission: SMS notification permission, which is used to alert the user when an inventory item’s quantity drops to zero. In the future, the app may request additional permissions, such as access to the camera and storage, to allow users to upload product images. However, MyInventory will only request the permissions necessary for the app’s functionality.
